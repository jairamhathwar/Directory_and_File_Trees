Student 1: What unauthorized sources of information did you use to
complete the assignment? List any unauthorized sources of information
that you used to complete the assignment, and describe how you used
them. The course "Policies" web page defines unauthorized sources of
information, and any source that you have used but not listed in the
authorized sources should be included here. Please note that using an
unauthorized source may trigger a course penalty, and depending on the
nature of the interaction, may additionally require the interaction
being reported to the Committee on Discipline. Write "None" if you used
no unauthorized sources of information.

None

Student 1: What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful?
Was it fun?

It was very tedious but also helped me engrain the fundamentals of C.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Student 2: What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful?
Was it fun?

It was difficult learning how to read other people's code but overall
was beneficial for my understanding.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?

N/A

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate for Part 2's checker, and what are
your disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and
express your disagreement after each warning. If there are no
warnings, then write "None."

None

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on checkerDT.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

None

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate on your Part 3 code, and what are
your disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and
express your disagreement after each warning. If there are no
warnings, then write "None."
 
ft.c: (in function FT_traversePath)
      ft.c:79:42: Variable ulChildID used before definition
        An rvalue is used that may not be initialized to a value on some
        execution path.
nodeFT.c: (in function Node_newFile)
      nodeFT.c:157:48: Variable ulIndex used before definition
      nodeFT.c: (in function Node_newDir)
      nodeFT.c:258:48: Variable ulIndex used before definition
      nodeFT.c: (in function Node_free)
      nodeFT.c:298:35: Variable ulIndex used before definition

The above warning was given in the DT_traversePath() from part 2 in the
code provided, so it was not altered here for part 3 and so cannot be
initialized.

ft.h:69:9: Function exported but not used outside ft: FT_containsFile
   ft.c:343:1: Definition of FT_containsFile

The ft.h was given to us and we not use it in our implementation, but
we decided to not touch it in ft.h.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on your Part 3 code, and what are
your disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and
express your disagreement after each warning. If there are no
warnings, then write "None."

ft.c: line 227: medium priority:
      Do you want to validate 'pvContents' through an assert?
   
ft.c: line 419: medium priority:
      Do you want to validate 'pvNewContents' through an assert?

nodeFT.c: line 41: medium priority:
      Do you want to validate 'pvNewContents' through an assert?

nodeFT.c: line 80: medium priority:
      Do you want to validate 'pvNewContents' through an assert?

Contents can be null, so these critiques are invalid/unnecessary.

For each of the five faulty BDT implementations required by Step
1.5, identify the function where there is a bug. You do not have to
identify the bug itself, only its location, but note that this must be
the location of the underlying error, which is not necessarily where
the error manifests itself or is "noticed" by the client.


      Executable         Function with the underlying error
===============================================================
         ./bdtBad1        BDT_insert()
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad2        BDT_freeSubtree()
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad3        BDT_addChild()
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad4        BDT_strlenAccumulate()
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad5        BDT_findNode()
===============================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What are your critiques of the given DT implementations, as
specified in Step 2.5?

There are many critiques to the given DT implementation. Firstly, the
nodeDT, Node_getChild, Node_hasChild, and Node_new functions in
nodeDTGood.c all have inconsistent parameter orders. For example,
Node_getChild does not follow listing all types of parameters
together, but instead separates Node_T types by a size_t.

Furthermore, the Node_getChild and Node_hasChild functions in 
nodeDTGood.c may also be considered redundant as Node_hasChild functions
can be included easily within the functionality of Node_getChild by 
returning some specific int for if the node has no child.

Additionally, for the DT_toString method in dtGood.c it is also not
needed for it have 3 helper functions when, for example, 
DT_strlenAccumulate() just concatenates strings together using just an
if statement. This function could easily be incorporated into the main
DT_toString method.

Also, for one of the helper functions called by the DT_toString method,
DT_preOrderTraversal(), there is some questionable naming going on with
all of the variables, as they are just random letters in the alphabet
that do not reveal information about what they represent.
